That is, it is a way to format a text.\n-   Similar but much simpler than **html**, or **rtf**.\n-   E.g. putting an asterisk around the text will make it italic and two asterisks bold:\\\n    \\*example\\* becomes *example*\\\n    \\*\\*another example\\*\\* becomes **another example**\n-   **markdown** was developed in 2004 by John Gruber as an easy way to create texts on websites.\n:::\n\n## \n\n::: incremental\n-   Texts in **mardown** are rendered (translated) to other markup languages before they are turned to webpages or documents.\n-   The idea is: You type a text with basic format tags and later let the computer render it to a more complex format.\n-   Due to its simplicity, **markdown** can be converted to *html*, *latex*, *docx*, *rtf*, ect. files.\n-   Markdown is widely applied on various sites (e.g., ***GitHub, Reddit, Diaspora, OpenStreetMap, sourceForge***).\n:::\n\n##  {.smaller}\n\nA text like this:\n\n    # Chaper 1\n\n    > If something is true, no amount of wishful thinking will change it *-Richard Dawkins*\n\n    We will discuss the following ideas:\n\n    1. The meaning of **life**\n    2. The end of **suffering**\n    3. The **noble eightfold path**\n\n    | Sanskrit| Meaning |\n    |---------|---------|\n    | dukkha  | suffering is an innate characteristic of existence. |\n    | samudaya| together with *dukkha* arises *taṇhā* (craving). |\n    | nirodha | *dukkha* can be ended or contained by letting go of this *taṇhā.* |\n    | magga   | The *noble eightfold path* leads to the confinement. |\n\n    Tabel 1: [The four noble truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths)\n\n## Three outputs:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Word\n\n![](images/paste-3DDCF0F1.png)\n\n## html\n\n![](images/paste-EEF87302.png)\n\n## pdf\n\n![](images/paste-73452D3D.png)\n:::\n\n## Rmarkdown\n\n::: incremental\n-   Rmarkdown is an extension to markdown.\n-   Specifically developed to combine data analyses (scripts and output) within a document.\n-   Think of it as an integration of a text-processing program and R code.\n-   You can write a text and implement tables, plots, figures etc. analysed with R.\n:::\n\n## Why use Rmarkdown?\n\n-   Rmarkdown helps to make your research:\n    -   Transparent\n    -   Reproducible\n    -   Organized\n    -   Communicatable\n\n## Why use Rmarkdown?\n\n-   You can create individualized reports\n    -   E.g. results with a standard text for each participant in a study comprising her own data\n    -   E.g. individual analyses for each single school or classroom but with a common text.\n    -   You can even adapt text blocks depending on parameters and specific results (e.g. skip certain passages for special schools but not for primary schools)\n\n## Task\n\nBefore we go on, you have to start your first Rmarkdown document:\n\n-   Create a new source file in R. Choose ***\"Text File\"*** as the format.\\\n    File ![](img/right_arrow.jpg){width=\"30\"} New File ![](img/right_arrow.jpg){width=\"30\"} Text File\n-   Save it under the name \"first_mardown.Rmd\"\\\n    (you can name it as you like as long as it ends with \".Rmd\").\n-   Now, at the lower right corner of your source panel you should find ![](img/Rmarkdown_dropdown.png){hight=\"30\"} as an indicator of the file type.\n-   Also, at the top of the source file you should find ![](img/knit_symbol.png){hight=\"30\"}\n\n# Basic markdown formating {background-image=\"img/bg-h1-3.jpg\"}\n\n## Basic markdown: header\n\n-   Normally written text appears as unformatted text.\n-   You can format text into a header with the `#` symbol:\n\n``` r\n# A level one header\n## A level two header\n### A level three header\n#### A level four header\n```\n\n## Basic markdown: Emphasise\n\n-   Italic text is put between `*` symbols (or `_`).\n-   Bold text between `**` symbols.\n-   Italic and bold text between `***` symbols.\n\n`This is *italic* this is **bold**, and ***this is both!!!***.`\n\nThis is *italic* this is **bold**, and ***this is both!!!***.\n\n## Basic markdown: Lists {.smaller}\n\n``` r\nAn unordered list:\n\n- Helmut\n- Gerhard\n- Angela\n\nAn ordered list:\n\n1. Bush\n2. Obama\n3. Trump\n\nCombined:\n  \n1. Sour\n  - Lime\n  - Envy\n2. Sweet\n  - Honey\n  - love\n```\n\n# Rmarkdown {background-image=\"img/bg-h1-3.jpg\"}\n\n## Chunks\n\n-   `Chunks` are portions of R code within a markdown file.\n-   A chunk for R has the following structure:\n\n\\`\\`\\`{r}\\\n\\# Here comes the R code\\\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n-   An empty chunk can be inserted directly through the `Insert` button.\n\n## Chunk Options {.smaller}\n\n-   Chunk options specify the \"behaviour\" of a chunk.\n-   They are put behind the leading \"r\" and are separated by \",\".\n\ne.g.:\n\n\\`\\`\\`{r echo = FALSE}\\\n\\# Here comes the R code\\\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n-   `echo = FALSE` suppresses the inclusion of the original R code and only output is reported.\n-   `include = FALSE` executes the R code but does not report anything\n-   `message = FALSE` excludes additional messages given by a function.\n-   `warning = FALSE` exclude warnings created by a function.\n\n## YAML (YAML is not a markup language) {.smaller}\n\n-   Through YAML you can set several document parameters.\n-   YAML is like a document header at the beginning of an Rmarkdown file. It is put between leading and ending \"---\".\n\n``` r\n---\n  \n---\n```\n\nSome possible parameters:\n\n-   title: \"My first document\"\n-   author: \"Jürgen Wilbert\"\n-   date: 12.12.2019\n-   abstract: This is an interesting paper\n\n## Additional ressources for Rmarkdown\n\n-   Cheatsheet:\\\n    <https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf>\n-   R Markdown: The Definitive Guide\\\n    <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>\n\n## Task\n\n-   Download the ***Rmarkdown silly example*** from the R moodle course.\n-   Save it to your project folder.\n-   Open it in RStudio.\n-   Knit an html and Word Docx file from it.\n-   Read through the code and make sure you understand all of it :-)\n",
