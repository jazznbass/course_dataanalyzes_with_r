# Extending R

## libraries, packages, and repositories

>- A "fresh" **R** installation already contains hundreds of *functions*.  
>- Functions are organized in **libraries**.
>- Libraries address a certain topic or area (e.g., graphics, a specific statstical method)
>- A **package** is a 'container' for distributing and sharing *libraries*.
>- You can add additional packages to extend you R installation.
>- Additional packages are provided in **repositories** or in seperate files. 
>- Repositories are online data storages.
>- The most important repository for *R* is CRAN <img src="images/R_logo.png" width="30" /> (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)

## Installing and activating new packages {.build}

>- You find a list of all CRAN packages on  
https://cran.r-project.org/ <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> Packages
>- You get an overview of all functions within a package with the `help()` or short `?` function.
>- You can directly install a package from CRAN with the `install.packages()` function.

After successful installation, add on packages have to be activated and loaded into memory in each *R* sesssion with the `library()` function.  
Note: You only install once, but you use `library()` each time you restart **R** or **R Studio**.

## Task

Install the packages `psych` and `tidyverse`.  
Activate both packages with  
`library(tidyverse)`  
`library(psych)`  

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("psych", "tidyverse"))
```

# R Studio projects

## R-Studio projects {.build}

As soon as you have more tham one source file and/or external data, it makes sense to start a `project` instead of just using single `source` files.

- A project is a feature of R Studio, not of R. 
- A project always hosted in a folder on your harddrive.
- All scripts, data, and other files are stored in that folder.
- When later opening a project, the *working directory* is directly set to the folder location.

<div class="blue2">***Working directory***:</div> The place on your harddrive R will save and load data from by default (i.e. when no other place is explicitly set). Use the `getwd()` and `setwd()` functions to get and set the working directory.

## Starting an R-Studio project {.build}

You can start a `project` from R studio through:

1. File <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> New Project ...
2. Now choose whether you already have a folder you like to start a project in or you create a new empty folder for an R project.
3. Choose New R Project as the project type.
4. Choose a directory name and start the project.

## Task {.build}

- Create a new R project with a name of your choice (e.g. 'R_course'). 
- Copy all your R scripts related to this R course into that new project folder.
- Close and reopen R Studio
- Open the project through:
  - File <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> Recent projects
  - Or the project menue in the uper right corner of R Studio

# External data

## Importing a data set from Excel

- The `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package (included in `tidyverse`) is used to import files created by Microsoft Excel.
- Alternatively: R Studio provided an easy way to import data:  
File <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> Import Dataset <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> From Excel
- But if you want to have a full script that runs by itself, I recommend to use the R functions.
- Store your data within your R project folder.
- If you do not install it there, you need to know the folder location to load it into R.

## Example

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
dat <- read_xlsx("cars.xlsx")
names(dat) # this function shows the variable names of a data frame 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(dat, 3)
```

## Task

- Download the Excel file "cars.xlsx" from the moodle course.  
- Save it in your project directory.  
- Import the data set and assign it to an object `dat`.  
- Apply the `View()` function to see the dataset.

Note: `View()` opens a new tab in RStudio with the content of a data frame (e.g. `View(dat)`).

## Task {.build}

- Calculate the *mean* of `mpg` (miles per gallon) for cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders (variable `cly`).

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

- Calculate the *mean* of `mpg` (miles per gallon) for cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders (variable `cly`).

```{r eval=FALSE}
dat_4 <- dat[dat[["cyl"]] == 4, "mpg"]
dat_6 <- dat[dat[["cyl"]] == 6, "mpg"]
dat_8 <- dat[dat[["cyl"]] == 8, "mpg"]
mean(dat_4)
mean(dat_6)
mean(dat_8)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
dat_4 <- mtcars[mtcars[["cyl"]] == 4, "mpg"]
dat_6 <- mtcars[mtcars[["cyl"]] == 6, "mpg"]
dat_8 <- mtcars[mtcars[["cyl"]] == 8, "mpg"]
mean(dat_4)
mean(dat_6)
mean(dat_8)
```
