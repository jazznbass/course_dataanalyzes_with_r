# Basic concepts

## Functions {.build}

- With a *function* you command the computer to do something.
- *functions* have a function name (e.g., `mean`, `sqrt`).
- *functions* take **arguments** to specify what to do.
- *arguments* have argument names as well.
- functions **always** consist of a function name followed by brackets.

`function_name(argument_name = value, argumentname = value, ...)`

## Examples {.build}

```{r }
# sqrt calculates the square root
sqrt(x = 16)

# You can omit the argument name if it is the first argument
sqrt(16)

# Even without arguments you still need the brackets
date()
```

## Help files

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Function
help("sqrt")

# Short cut
?sqrt
```

... or use the bottom-right help panel in R Studio

## Task 

Take a look at the `mean()` function:  
What *arguments* could be specified?


<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

---

```{r eval=FALSE}
help("mean")
?mean
```

The mean function takes three arguments:

* x : A vector with values
* trim : A fraction (e.g. 0.3) of values that are trimmed from each each end of the vector x 
* na.rm : If TRUE (na.rm = TRUE), missing values (NAs) are removed before calculating the mean

## Operations {.build}

Operations are a special kind of functions that have a shortcut.

```{r results = "hide"}
# function `assign` and the short cut
assign(x = "y", value = 10)

y <- 10
```

```{r results = "hide"}
# function `+`
"+"(e1 = 10, e2 = 10)

10 + 10
```
```{r results = "hide"}
# function `print`
print(x = y)

y
```

## Objects

Objects (also called variables) have an object name and contain data.  
The data are assigned to an object with the `<-` or `=` operator.

```{r}
x <- 10
```

You can see the value(s) of an object with the `print()` function, or by just typing the object name:

```{r results = "hide"}
print(x)
x
```
---

Objects can be used for operators and arguments in functions:

```{r results = "hide"}
x <- 16
y <- 13

x * y
sqrt(x)
```

You can write the return values of a function into a new object:
```{r results = "hide"}
z <- sqrt(x)
z
```
And you can combine these:

```{r results = "hide"}
exp(z) + sqrt(y)

```

## Task {.build}

Assign the values `40 and 24` to the variables `a and b`. Calculate the square root of the sum of `a and b`.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Assign the values `40 and 24` to the variables `a and b`. Calculate the square root of the sum of `a and b`.

```{r}
a <- 40
b <- 24
sqrt(a + b)
```

## Data types {.build}

The data of objects can be numbers, text or TRUE/FALSE values.
These are called **data types**

- **Numeric**: e.g. Integer or decimal numbers `1, 1.35` 
- **Character**: Always between " " or ' ' signs: `"A", 'House'`
- **Logical**:  `TRUE, FALSE`

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- "Hello world!"
z <- FALSE
```

## Data structures {.build}

Data are organized in structures:

>- **Atomic vectors**: A single value
>- **Vectors**: A chain of values
>- **Factors**: Values with assigned labels
>- **List**: A series elements, each one containing one or more (atomic)  vectors
>- **Data Frames**: A list with one vector for each element and all vectors of the same length
>- **Matrix**: A two dimensional table with values of the same data type.
>- **Array**: Like a matrix but with more dimensions.

## Data structures

Data are organized in structures:

- **Atomic vectors**: A single value
- <div class="red2">**Vectors**: A chain of values</div>
- <div class="red2">**Factors**: Values with assigned labels</div>
- **List**: A series elements, each one containing one or more (atomic)  vectors
- <div class="red2">**Data Frames**: A list with one vector for each element and all vectors of the same length</div>
- **Matrix**: A two dimensional table with values of the same data type.
- **Array**: Like a matrix but with more dimensions.

## How to build a vector {.build}

You create a vector with the `c()` function:

```{r}
c(2, 4, 6, 3, 7)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 3, 7)
y
```

The colon `:` operator creates a numerical sequence:

```{r results = "hide"}
1:10
```

---

You can build a vector of any data type:

```{r}
firstname <- c("Dustin", "Mike", "Will")
curly <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
age <- c(9, 11, 10)
```

But do not mix data types in a vector. You will get an error or they are internally changed:

```{r}
age <- c("quite young", 10, 12, "very old")
age
```

## Task {.build}

Create a vector (named `friends` comprising four names of your friends.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Create a vector (named `friends` comprising four names of your friends.

```{r}
friends <- c("Matthias", "Markus", "Thomas", "Christian")
```

## Combining vectors to new vectors {.build}

When an object is a vector it can be reused within the `c()` function to build a new vector:

```{r}
x <- c(3, 5, 7)
c(x, 5, 8, 9)

```

## Combining vectors to new vectors {.build}

Be careful not to confuse an object name with a character:

```{r error = TRUE}
x <- c("A", "B", "C")
c("x", "D", "E", "F")
c(x, "D", "E", "F")
c(A, B, C)

```

## Missing values

A missing value is represented with `NA` (**N**ot **A**vailable).

```{r}
age <- c(9, NA, 11)
name <- c("Tick", "Trick", NA)
age
name

```

## Task {.build}

Create a vector with the values `2, 5, 7, 4, 7, 2, 6`. Calculate the `mean` of these values. (Note: Use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean).

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Create a vector with the values `2, 5, 7, 4, 7, 2, 6`. Calculate the `mean` of these values. (Note: Use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean).


```{r}
x <- c(2, 5, 7, 4, 7, 2, 6)
mean(x)
```

## Task {.build}

Create a vector with the values `2, NA, 7, 4, NA, 2, 6`. Calculate the `mean` of these values.  
(Note: Read through `?mean` if you encounter problems.)

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Create a vector with the values `2, NA, 7, 4, NA, 2, 6`. Calculate the `mean` of these values.  
(Note: Read through `?mean` if you encounter problems.)

```{r}
x <- c(2, NA, 7, 4, NA, 2, 6)
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```


## Selecting elements with square brackets {.build}

```{r}
names <- c("Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Amy")
names[1]

# Pass a vector to extract multiple elements:
names[c(1,4)]

```

## Task {.build}

Take the vector  
`names <- c("Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Amy")`  
and reorder it to get the following result:  
`[1] "Sheldon" "Amy"     "Sheldon" "Amy"     "Leonard" "Penny"`

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution 

Take the vector  
`names <- c("Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Amy")`  
and reorder it to get the following result:  
`[1] "Sheldon" "Amy"     "Sheldon" "Amy"     "Leonard" "Penny"`

```{r}
x <- c(1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3)
new_order <- names[x]
new_order
```

## A factor {.build .smaller}

A factor is a vector with labels for vector levels. E.g., a vector contains the values 0 and 1 where 0 stands for "with behavioral problems" and 1 stands for ""without behavioral problems".

A factor is created with the `factor()` function.

```{r}
sen <- factor(c(1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0), levels =  c(0, 1), labels = c("No SEN", "With SEN"))
sen
```
## Task {.build}

Build a factor for `gender` with the labels `male, female, non-binary`. Include a vector for six fictitious gender values.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Build a factor for `gender` with the labels `male, female, non-binary`. Include a vector for six fictitious gender values.

```{r}
gender <- factor(
  c(1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1), 
  levels = 1:3, 
  labels = c("male", "female", "non-binary")
)
gender
```

## How to build a data frame {.build .smaller}

Data frames are the standard object for storing research data. They contain variables (columns) and cases (rows). A data frame is created with the `data.frame()` function.

```{r}
# For better convenience I have inserted additional linebreaks and spaces
study <- data.frame(
  sen    = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1),
  gender = c("M", "M", "F", "M", "F", "F"),
  age    = c(12, 13, 11, 10, 11, 14),
  IQ     = c(90, 85, 90, 87, 99, 89)
)
study
```

## Extracting a variable from a data frame

Variables within a data frame are extracted with double square brackets.

```{r}
study[["sen"]]
study[["IQ"]]
```

*Note: an alternative approach is to use the `$` sign: `study$sen`. But we will not use this approach for now.*

## Subsetting a data frame

Specific cases are selected within square brackets: 
`object_name[rows, columns]`.

```{r}
study[5, ]
study[c(2, 6), ]
```

---

```{r}
study[c(2, 6), "IQ"]
study[c(2, 6), c("sen", "IQ")]
```

---

You could also use numbers to address the columns:

```{r}
study[, 2]
study[c(2, 6), c(1, 3)]
```

## Task {.build}

Please create a new data frame (`study2`) comprising the `gender` and `age` variables for the cases 1, 3, and 5 of the `study` data frame.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Please create a new data frame (`study2`) comprising the `gender` and `age` variables for the cases 1, 3, and 5 of the `study` data frame.

```{r}
study2 <- study[c(1, 3, 5), c("gender", "age")]
study2
```

# Sophisticated selections

## Relational operators {.build}

Relational operators compare two values and return a logical value (`TRUE` or `FALSE`)

|Operator|Relation|Example|
|----|----------------|--------|
|`==`|is identical|x == y|
|`!=`|is not identical|x != y|
|`>`|is greater|x > y|
|`>=`|is greater or identical|x >= y|  
|`<`|is less|x < y|
|`<=`|is less or identical|x <=  y|  

## Examples {.build}

```{r}
7 > 2
7 <=  10
5 == 4
5 != 6
```

## Relational vectors and characters

Only `==` and `!=` can be applied to non numerical objects:

```{r}
"Hamster" == "Mouse"
"Hamster" != "Mouse"
```

## Relational operators and vectors {.smaller}

```{r}
age <- c(12, 4, 3, 8, 4, 2, 1)
age < 5
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame(age = age, 'age < 5' = age < 5, check.names = FALSE)
```

## Using logical vectors to select values

When you put a logical vector within square brackets `[ ]` after an object, all elements of that object with a `TRUE` in the logical vector are selected:

```{r}
age <- c(12, 4, 3, 8)
x <- age > 5
x
age[x]
```

## Using logical vectors to select values

```{r eval=FALSE}
age <- c(12, 4, 3, 8)
x <- age > 5
age[x]
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame(age = age, x = x, 'Select?' = ifelse(x, "**select**", "drop"), "Result" = ifelse(x, age, ""), check.names = FALSE)
```

## Task {.build}

Create a new vector `friends <- c(4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 3)`. Show all values of that vector `>= 4`.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution 

Create a new vector `friends <- c(4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 3)`. Show all values of that vector `>= 4`.

```{r}
friends <- c(4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 3)
friends[friends >= 4]
```


## which() {.build .smaller}

The `which()` functions gives the **indices** of the elements that are `TRUE`.  
It takes a *logical vector* as an *argument*.

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
which(x)

age <- c(12, 4, 3, 8)
x <- age < 5
x
which(x)
```

---

```{r eval = FALSE}
age <- c(12, 4, 3, 8)
x <- age < 5
x
which(x)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame('Index' = 1:length(x), '`age`' = age, '`x <- age < 5`' = x, '`which(x)`' = ifelse(x, 1:length(x), ""), check.names = FALSE)
```

## Task {.build}

Create a vector `x <- c(1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5)` and identify:  
Which elements are larger or equal than three?     
Create a new vector from `x` containing all elements that are **not** four. Note: Use the `which()` function for this task.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Create a vector `x <- c(1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5)` and identify:  
Which elements are larger or equal than three?     
Create a new vector from `x` containing all elements that are **not** four. Note: Use the `which()` function for this task.


```{r}
x <- c(1, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5)
which(x >= 3)
y <- x[which(x != 4)]
y
```

## Selecting cases with logical vectors {.build}

Logical vectors can also be appplied to *data frame* for selecting cases:

```{r}
# Either directly:
study_no_sen <- study[study[["sen"]] == 0, ]
study_no_sen

# Or using the which() function
filter <- which(study[["sen"]] == 0)
study_no_sen <- study[filter, ]
```

## Task {.build}

Calculate the `mean` of `IQ` for students with and without sen.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

## Task - solution

Calculate the `mean` of `IQ` for students with and without sen.

```{r}
filter <- which(study[["sen"]] == 0)
mean(study$IQ[filter])

filter <- which(study[["sen"]] == 1)
mean(study[["sen"]][filter])
```

## Logical Operations

Logical operations are applied to logical values. 

|Operator| Operation|Example|Results|
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
|`!`|Not|`! x`|`TRUE when x = FALSE and FALSE when x = TRUE`|
|`&`|AND|`x & y`|`TRUE when x and y are TRUE else FALSE`|
|`|`|OR|`x | y`|`TRUE when x or y is TRUE else FALSE`|

## Example {.build .smaller}

```{r}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
```

```{r}
!x
!y
x & y
x | y
```

## Logical Operator with vectors {.build .smaller}

When applied to **two** vectors, logical operations result in a new vector.  
Operations are applied to each element one by one.

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE,  FALSE)
y <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

```{r}
!x
x & y
x | y
```

## Task {.build}

Create two vectors:

`glasses <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)` 
`hyperintelligent <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)`

Determine for each element whether 'glasses' and 'hyperintelligent' are TRUE at the same time.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

```{r}
glasses <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
hyperintelligent <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
glasses & hyperintelligent
```

## Task - solutions

Create two vectors:

`glasses <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)` 
`hyperintelligent <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)`

Determine for each element whether 'glasses' and 'hyperintelligent' are TRUE at the same time.

```{r}
glasses <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
hyperintelligent <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
glasses & hyperintelligent
```

---

```{r echo = FALSE}
data.frame('glasses' = glasses, 'hyperintelligent' = hyperintelligent,  'glasses & hyperintelligent' = glasses & hyperintelligent, check.names = FALSE)
```

## Combining logical and relational operators {.build}

```{r}
age <- c(12, 4, 3, 8, 4, 2, 1, 7, 4)
gender <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
age > 4
gender == 0
age > 4 & gender == 0
```

## Task {.build .smaller}

Create a vector  
`income <- c(5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000)` and a vector  
`happiness <- c(20, 35, 30, 10, 50)`.  
Use *relational* and *logical* operations to determine for each element whether the `income` is larger than `2500` and at the same time `happiness` is above `25`.

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

```{r}
income <- c(5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000)
happiness <- c(20, 35, 30, 10, 50)
income > 2500 & happiness > 25
```

## Task - solution {.smaller}

Create a vector  
`income <- c(5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000)` and a vector  
`happiness <- c(20, 35, 30, 10, 50)`.  
Use *relational* and *logical* operations to determine for each element whether the `income` is larger than `2500` and at the same time `happiness` is above `25`.

```{r}
income <- c(5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000)
happiness <- c(20, 35, 30, 10, 50)
income > 2500 & happiness > 25
```

---

```{r eval = FALSE}
income <- c(5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000)
happiness <- c(20, 35, 30, 10, 50)
income > 2500 & happiness > 25
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
kable(data.frame('income' = income, 'happiness' = happiness, 'income > 2500' = income > 2500, 'happiness > 25' = happiness > 25, 'income > 2500 &<br>happiness > 25' = income > 2500 & happiness > 25, check.names = FALSE))

```

## Subsetting data frames with logical and relational operators {.build .smaller}

```{r}
study
filter <- which(study[["sen"]] == 1 & study[["gender"]] == "M")
study[filter, ]
```

## Task

Use the `ChickWeight` data frame for the following task.  
The data set is already included in R.

1. Look into the data set with `?ChickWeight`.
2. Get all variable names of the data frame with the `names()` function (`names(ChickWeight)`).
3. Select cases from **ChickWeight** with `Diet == 1` and `Time < 16`.
4. For these cases, calculate the correlation between `weight` and `Time`. Note: Use the `cor()` function (e.g., `cor(x, y)`)
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for `Diet == 4`.
6. What can you see?

<div class="red2">**Please stop the video here! Continue after completing the task!**</div> 

---

```{r}
filter <- ChickWeight[["Diet"]] ==  1 & ChickWeight[["Time"]] < 16
diet1 <- ChickWeight[filter,]
cor(diet1[["weight"]], diet1[["Time"]])
filter <- ChickWeight[["Diet"]] ==  4 & ChickWeight[["Time"]] < 16
diet4 <- ChickWeight[filter,]
cor(diet4[["weight"]], diet4[["Time"]])
```

# Extending R

## libraries, packages, and repositories

>- A "fresh" **R** installation already contains hundreds of *functions*.  
>- Functions are organized in **libraries**.
>- Libraries address a certain topic or area (e.g., graphics, a specific statstical method)
>- A **package** is a 'container' for distributing and sharing *libraries*.
>- You can add additional packages to extend you R installation.
>- Additional packages are provided in **repositories** or in seperate files. 
>- Repositories are online data storages.
>- The most important repository for *R* is CRAN <img src="images/R_logo.png" width="30" /> (The Comprehensive R Archive Network)

## Installing and activating new packages {.build}

>- You find a list of all CRAN packages on  
https://cran.r-project.org/ <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> Packages
>- You get an overview of all functions within a package with the `help()` or short `?` function.
>- You can directly install a package from CRAN with the `install.packages()` function.

After successful installation, add on packages have to be activated and loaded into memory in each *R* sesssion with the `library()` function.  
Note: You only install once, but you use `library()` each time you restart **R** or **R Studio**.

## Task

Install the packages `psych` and `tidyverse`.  
Activate both packages with  
`library(tidyverse)`  
`library(psych)`  

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("psych", "tidyverse"))
```

# R Studio projects

## R-Studio projects {.build}

As soon as you have more tham one source file and/or external data, it makes sense to start a `project` instead of just using single `source` files.

- A project is a feature of R Studio, not of R. 
- A project always hosted in a folder on your storage.
- All scripts, data, and other files are stored in that folder.
- When later opening a project, the *working directory* is directly set to the folder location.

<div class="blue2">***Working directory***:</div> The place on your harddrive R will save and load data from by default (i.e. when not other place is explicitly set). Use the `getwd()` and `setwd()` functions to get and set the working directory.

## Starting an R-Studio project {.build}

You can start a `project` from R studio through:

1. File <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> New Project ...
2. Now choose whether you already have a folder you like to start a project in or you create a new empty folder for an R project.
3. Choose New R Project as the project type.
4. Choose a directory name and start the project.

## Task {.build}

- Create a new R project with a name of your choice (e.g. 'R_course'). 
- Copy all your R scripts related to this R course into that new project folder.
- Close and reopen R Studio
- Open the project through:
  - File <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> Recent projects
  - Or the project menue in the uper right corner of R Studio

# External data

## Importing a data set from Excel

- The `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package (included in `tidyverse`) is used to import files created by Microsoft Excel.
- Alternatively: R Studio provided an easy way to import data:  
File <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> Import Dataset <img src="images/right_arrow.jpg" width="30" /> From Excel
- But if you want to have a full script that runs by itself, I recommend to use the R functions.
- Store your data within your R project folder.
- If you do not install it there, you need to know the folder location to load it into R.

## Example

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readxl)
dat <- read_xlsx("cars.xlsx")
names(dat) # this function shows the variable names of a data frame

```{r echo = FALSE}
head(dat, 3)
```


## Task

- Download the Excel file "cars.xlsx" from the moodle course.  
- Save it in your project directory.  
- Import the data set and assign it to an object `dat`.  
- Apply the `View()` function to see the dataset.

Note: `View()` opens a new tab in RStudio with the content of a data frame (e.g. `View(dat)`).

## Task {.build}

- Calculate the *mean* of `mpg` (miles per gallon) for cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders (variable `cly`). Note: Use `$` to select variables from the dataset.

```{r}
mean(dat$mpg[dat$cyl == 4])
mean(dat$mpg[dat$cyl == 6])
mean(dat$mpg[dat$cyl == 8])
```
