## Goals {.emphasized .flexbox .vcenter data-background="images/DEFOCUSED.png" data-background-size="cover"}

-   You know what mardown is.
-   You know what you can do with Rmarkdown.
-   You can create your own Rmarkdown files.

# Markdown and Rmarkdown {background-image="images/bg-h1-3.jpg"}

## What is **markdown**?

::: incremental
-   It is a very simple document *markup language*. That is, it is a way to format a text.
-   Similar but much simpler than **html**, or **rtf**.
-   E.g. putting an asterisk around the text will make it italic and two asterisks bold:\
    \*example\* becomes *example*\
    \*\*another example\*\* becomes **another example**
-   **markdown** was developed in 2004 by John Gruber as an easy way to create texts on websites.
:::

## 

::: incremental
-   Texts in **mardown** are rendered (translated) to other markup languages before they are turned to webpages or documents.
-   The idea is: You type a text with basic format tags and later let the computer render it to a more complex format.
-   Due to its simplicity, **markdown** can be converted to *html*, *latex*, *docx*, *rtf*, ect. files.
-   Markdown is widely applied on various sites (e.g., ***GitHub, Reddit, Diaspora, OpenStreetMap, sourceForge***).

##  {.smaller}

A text like this:

    # Chaper 1

    > If something is true, no amount of wishful thinking will change it *-Richard Dawkins*

    We will discuss the following ideas:

    1. The meaning of **life**
    2. The end of **suffering**
    3. The **noble eightfold path**

    | Sanskrit| Meaning |
    |---------|---------|
    | dukkha  | suffering is an innate characteristic of existence. |
    | samudaya| together with *dukkha* arises *taṇhā* (craving). |
    | nirodha | *dukkha* can be ended or contained by letting go of this *taṇhā.* |
    | magga   | The *noble eightfold path* leads to the confinement. |

## Rmarkdown

::: incremental
-   Rmarkdown is an extension to markdown.
-   Specifically developed to combine data analyses (scripts and output) within a document.
-   Think of it as an integration of a text-processing program and R code.
-   You can write a text and implement tables, plots, figures etc. analysed with R.
:::

## Why use Rmarkdown?

-   Rmarkdown helps to make your research:
    -   Transparent
    -   Reproducible
    -   Organized
    -   Communicatable

## Why use Rmarkdown?

-   You can create individualized reports
    -   E.g. results with a standard text for each participant in a study comprising her own data
    -   E.g. individual analyses for each single school or classroom but with a common text.
    -   You can even adapt text blocks depending on parameters and specific results (e.g. skip certain passages for special schools but not for primary schools)

## Task

Before we go on, you have to start your first Rmarkdown document:

-   Create a new source file in R. Choose ***"Text File"*** as the format.\
    File ![](images/right_arrow.jpg){width="30"} New File ![](images/right_arrow.jpg){width="30"} Text File
-   Save it under the name "first_mardown.Rmd"\
    (you can name it as you like as long as it ends with ".Rmd").
-   Now, at the lower right corner of your source panel you should find ![](images/Rmarkdown_dropdown.png){hight="30"} as an indicator of the file type.
-   Also, at the top of the source file you should find ![](images/knit_symbol.png){hight="30"}

# Basic markdown formating {background-image="images/bg-h1-3.jpg"}

## Basic markdown: header

-   Normally written text appears as unformatted text.
-   You can format text into a header with the `#` symbol:

``` r
# A level one header
## A level two header
### A level three header
#### A level four header
```

## Basic markdown: Emphasise

-   Italic text is put between `*` symbols (or `_`).
-   Bold text between `**` symbols.
-   Italic and bold text between `***` symbols.

`This is *italic* this is **bold**, and ***this is both!!!***.`

This is *italic* this is **bold**, and ***this is both!!!***.

## Basic markdown: Lists {.smaller}

``` r
An unordered list:

- Helmut
- Gerhard
- Angela

An ordered list:

1. Bush
2. Obama
3. Trump

Combined:
  
1. Sour
  - Lime
  - Envy
2. Sweet
  - Honey
  - love
```

## Chunks

-   `Chunks` are portions of R code within a markdown file.
-   A chunk for R has the following structure:

\`\`\`{r}\
\# Here comes the R code\
\`\`\`

-   An empty chunk can be inserted directly through the `Insert` button.

## Chunk Options {.smaller}

-   Chunk options specify the "behaviour" of a chunk.
-   They are put behind the leading "r" and are separated by ",".

e.g.:

\`\`\`{r echo = FALSE}\
\# Here comes the R code\
\`\`\`

-   `echo = FALSE` suppresses the inclusion of the original R code and only output is reported.
-   `include = FALSE` executes the R code but does not report anything
-   `message = FALSE` excludes additional messages given by a function.
-   `warning = FALSE` exclude warnings created by a function.

## YAML (YAML is not a markup language) {.smaller}

-   Through YAML you can set several document parameters.
-   YAML is like a document header at the beginning of an Rmarkdown file. It is put between leading and ending "---".

``` r
---
  
---
```

Some possible parameters:

-   title: "My first document"
-   author: "Jürgen Wilbert"
-   date: 12.12.2019
-   abstract: This is an interesting paper

## Task

-   Download the ***Rmarkdown silly example*** from the R moodle course.
-   Save it to your project folder.
-   Open it in RStudio.
-   Knit an html and Word Docx file from it.
-   Read through the code and make sure you understand all of it :-)
