- Installing R-Studio on your computer
- Overview of R-Studio

## What is R? {.build}

- A tool for statistical computation (like SPSS, Mplus, STATA ...)
- A programming language
- An idea and a community that shares common ideas about science


## Statements {.build}

- Science should be truthfull
- Science should be diligent
- Science should be transparent
- Science should be reproducible
- Science should be communicated
- Science should be accessible
- Science should be open

## R (and R studio) help with ...

- Science should be truthfull
- Science should be diligent
- <div class="red2">**Science should be transparent**</div>
- <div class="red2">**Science should be reproducible**</div>
- <div class="red2">**Science should be communicated**</div>

# What R can do

## Any kind of statistical analyses:

- Descriptive stats
- Modelling
- Inferential stats
- Manage and organize data
- Large data (large scale / big data / EEG / fMRT)
- Small data (experimental data / questionnaire data / single-case data)

## Present data

- Visualize data and results
- Keep a notebook of your research and analyses
- Write reports, including stats
- Write presentations
- Write books
- Build interactive websites
- Connect with various other software and internet tools
