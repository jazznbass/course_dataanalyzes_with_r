## Basic concepts

**Tasks.**

1. Create a numeric vector `x` with five values and compute its mean and standard deviation using base R.
2. Create a character vector `id` and a logical vector `passed` each of four elements. Combine them into a `data.frame` and inspect with `str()`.
2. Use `names()` to assign column names to a data frame you created and verify with `names(dat)`.
3. Create a  `q_1`, `q_2`, `q_3` up to `q_25` two times with `paste()` and  with `paste0()`.
1. Compute the square root of 2, the exponential of 1, and the natural logarithm of 10.
2. Create a `list` with three heterogeneous elements (numeric, character, logical). Access elements by name and by position.
3. Use `factor()` to create a factor with levels `A` and `B`. Show the internal integer representation with `as.numeric()`.
1. Add comment lines to three of the previous tasks. Use `#` for each line.
1. Add three section headers to your R script using `# ----` separators that help to organise your text.
1. Open the help page for `rank` with `?rank` and summarize what it does.
