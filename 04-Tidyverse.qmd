```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Goals

- You know what **tidyverse** is.
- Basic knowledge on the pipe `%>%` operator.

# Tidyverse {background-image="images/bg-h1-3.jpg"}

## Tidyverse is a collection of R packages developed for data science

- [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) was initiated (and is to a large part programmed) by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/).

::: incremental

- It is continuously developed and heavily promoted by RStudio.
- The core idea is to implement (more) [*functional programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) into R.
- All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structure.
- Although **tidyverse** is *loved* by many, there are also critics to it [worth reading](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/blob/master/README.md).
- Tidyverse can be installed through R (install.packages("tidyverse")).

# Pipes: `%>%`  {background-image="images/bg-h1-3.jpg"}

## An Example:

%>% takes the return of a function and **pipes** it to the next function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Without pipes (nested option):
kable(round(describe(select(dat, "iq", "age")), 2))

# or a second, better, alternative:
newdat <- select(dat, "iq", "age")
newdat <- describe(newdat)
newdat <- round(newdat, 2)
kable(newdat)
```
<br>
```{r eval = FALSE}
# And with pipes it looks like:
dat %>%
  select("iq", "age") %>%
  describe() %>%
  round(2) %>%
  kable()
```

## Task

- Take the `mtcars` data set (included in base R).
- Apply the `describe()` function from the `psych` library (make sure you have installed `psych`).
- Round the values to the first decimal (Note: `round()` is your friend here).
- Use pipes `%>%` to do this all.
- ... and don't forget to activate the `tidyverse` library :-)

mtcars %>%
  describe() %>%
  round(1)

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(psych)

mtcars %>%
  describe() %>%
  round(1) %>%
  html_table()
